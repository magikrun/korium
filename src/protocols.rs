//! Protocol trait definitions for Korium's networking layer.
//!
//! This module defines the core protocol traits that abstract over the
//! underlying RPC transport. Each protocol (DHT, PubSub, Relay)
//! has its own trait that defines the operations it supports.
//!
//! ## Protocol Traits
//!
//! | Protocol | Trait | Purpose |
//! |----------|-------|---------|
//! | DHT | [`DhtNodeRpc`] | Distributed hash table operations |
//! | PubSub | [`GossipSubRpc`] | Epidemic broadcast message forwarding |
//! | Relay | [`RelayRpc`] | NAT traversal via relay servers |
//! | Plain | [`PlainRpc`] | Point-to-point messaging |
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! Traits are defined here separately from implementations to:
//! - Allow protocols (GossipSub) to depend only on traits, not implementations
//! - Enable DHT to be passed to protocols for contact resolution
//! - Avoid circular dependencies between modules
